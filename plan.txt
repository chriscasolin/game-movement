map each tile to a tile.js object when it is first parsed.

it will have a tileState useState. a handler for this tilestate is passed to the logic classes
that belong to this tile.

implement interact(tileStateHandler) and break(tileStateHandler) methods for each tile.
classes should have static default values for BREAK_TIME, DROPS, etc.
